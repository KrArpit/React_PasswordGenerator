# Password Generator App

This is a simple password generator app that I built using React and Tailwind CSS. This project helped me learn about the basics of React, including:

- How to use React hooks like `useState, useCallback, useEffect & useRef`
- Writing JSX files
- Styling components with Tailwind CSS
- Understanding the basics of React component structure

## About the Project

This is my first project using React, and it focuses on generating random passwords based on user-selected criteria. The app is simple, but it was a great way for me to get hands-on experience with React and Tailwind.
